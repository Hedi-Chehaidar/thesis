\noindent
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those, who supported me morally and technically throughout this work.
\newline

\noindent
I would like to thank my supervisor Mihail Stoian for the continuous guidance, insightful feedback, and trust in my ideas. The discussions we had, from discussing ideas to detailed implementation improvements, helped shape the thesis and improve its quality. I am thankful for the encouragements and for pushing me to always explore more optimization possibilities.  
\noindent
I am grateful for the practical insights, constructive criticism, and technical expertise, especially regarding algorithmic correctness and performance evaluation. The feedback I received helped turn initial ideas into well-structured and measurable contributions.
\newline

\noindent
I am grateful to the broader research and open-source community whose work laid the foundation for this thesis. The availability of high-quality implementations, documentation, and discussions around compression methods made it possible to build upon existing work and focus on meaningful improvements.

\noindent
A special thanks goes to everyone who shared tools, datasets, or prior experience that helped accelerate experimentation and evaluation.
\newline

\noindent
Finally, I want to thank my friends and family for their constant support, patience, and encouragement throughout this journey. Their motivation helped me stay focused and enthusiastic, especially during long debugging sessions and performance tuning phases.
